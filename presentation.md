## Consider...

> "All of life is a dispute over taste and tasting."

Friedrich Nietzsche

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

## Or...

which is best --> which do I prefer ... under which circumstances ... and why?

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

## Consider...

> "I think it‚Äôs important to actually let the team try things and get their direct feedback on whether they enjoy working with a framework. If they do, then it‚Äôs a good indicator that they will be more productive than with, say, another framework. I wouldn‚Äôt say Vue is always more pleasant because some people do prefer React or prefer Angular.‚Äù

## My Goal

- Help you experience the **_flavor_** of the core of each library/framework

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

## Introducing the todo apps...

- https://codepen.io/collection/DprzEK/
- minimal, identical function
- similar code (while keeping the flavor's typical style)

<br><br><br><br>

## Comparison: Getting Started

- websites
- dependencies
- typical language/transpilation
- app bootstrapping boilerplate

<br><br><br><br>

## Comparison: Coding

- data/state
- looping DOM creation
- binding JS code to DOM events
- binding DOM to JS values
- two-way binding

<br><br><br><br>

## Other Comparisons

- [Real World](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) examples
- [Udemy instructor's take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMX1mFEmM3E)
